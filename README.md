Cafe Management System - WinForms Application

## Overview

The Cafe Management System is a Windows Forms (WinForms) application built using C#. This software simulates a simple cafe billing system where users can select various drinks and cakes, calculate costs, generate receipts, and reset the form for new orders.

The project is ideal for learning the basics of WinForms, user interface components, and simple billing systems. This program allows users to:
- Choose from a variety of drinks and cakes
- Calculate the total cost, including tax and service charge
- Generate and print a receipt
- Reset the form for new customers
- Save and open receipt details from text files

## Billing Functionality

### Total Calculation

The `Total` button calculates the total cost by considering:
- The price of each selected item
- A fixed service charge of 1.75 units
- A tax of 0.45% applied to the subtotal (the combined cost of items and service charge)

Hereâ€™s how the calculation works:
1. For each drink or cake, the total cost is calculated as:
   ```
   Item Total = Quantity of Item * Item Price
   ```
   Example:
   - If you order 2 Lattes and the price of a Latte is 1.20, the total cost for Lattes is:
     ```
     Latte Total = 2 * 1.20 = 2.40
     ```

2. The subtotal is the sum of the total costs of all selected drinks and cakes:
   ```
   Subtotal = Sum of all item totals + Service Charge
   ```

3. The tax is calculated as 0.45% of the subtotal:
   ```
   Tax = Subtotal * 0.0045
   ```

4. The total cost is the sum of the subtotal and the tax:
   ```
   Total Cost = Subtotal + Tax
   ```

### Receipt Generation

The `Receipt` button generates a detailed receipt that includes:
- A list of all the selected items and their respective quantities
- The service charge, tax, and total cost
- The current date and time when the receipt was generated

Example Receipt:
```
-------------------------------------------------------------
                    Cafe de Italiano
-------------------------------------------------------------
Latte                               2
Espresso                            1
Mocha                               3
...
-------------------------------------------------------------
Service Charge                      1.75
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tax                                 0.45
Sub Total                           12.85
Total Cost                          13.30
-------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Reset Functionality

The `Reset` button resets:
- All text fields to `0`
- All checkboxes to unchecked
- All cost labels (cake, drink, service charge, subtotal, tax, and total) to their default values

- Creating an admin panel for item management (add, remove, or modify items).
